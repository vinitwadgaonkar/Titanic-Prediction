Titanic Data Analysis
This script processes and analyzes the Titanic dataset, which contains information on the passengers who were on board the Titanic when it sank in 1912. The script performs the following tasks:

Importing necessary libraries and reading in the train and test datasets
Cleaning and preprocessing the data by dropping unnecessary columns, filling in missing values, and converting categorical data into numerical data using one-hot encoding
Performing exploratory data analysis on the data by visualizing the distribution of different variables and calculating correlations between variables
Preparing the data for model training by splitting the training data into feature data (x_df) and target data (y_df) and then creating a similar data structure for the test dataset
Prerequisites
In order to run this script, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Output
The script will produce several plots and tables as output, including:
Histograms showing the distribution of the 'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Age', and 'Pclass' variables
A correlation matrix showing the correlation between different variables in the dataset
Next steps
Once the data has been cleaned and preprocessed, it can be used to train a machine learning model. The script can then be modified to train and evaluate a model using the x_df and y_df data structures that were created as part of the data preparation process. The model can then be used to make predictions on the test dataset.
